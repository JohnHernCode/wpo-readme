A ton of information can be given about War Planet Online however, for the moment, I will just focus on things like strategies for growth and for faction growth. 

# Play Schedule Strategy for faster growth:

a. Hit renegades every 4 hours until stamina is depleted
b. Build your HQ or something your HQ requires
c. Run Black Ops.
d. Complete Battle pass
e. Faction Research
f. Personal Research
h. Craft a weapon
i. Order parts (if above level 10)
j. Combine cores (if you have that building available)
k. Attack dead bases/farms (if available)
l. Only gather from elites, especially during events
m. Hit a renegade base at least once a day, even if you cannot come close to defeating it|
n. Always have VIP activated 


# Why do we follow the above?

a. It only takes 15 minutes, about 4 times per day (every 4 hours)
b. The faster growth is based not on play time, but on how you play

# A bit of explanation:

1. Renegades bring 2 things: 
- experience (where the goal is level 50 for each character) and resources. 

If you are able to use Renegade Revenge (which you will be able to get with sentinel points as time goes on) then you have 15 minutes a day of free renegade hits. When you are at least level 23, your goal should be Renegade Revenge – Hit only level 21 renegades for thorium, and then use the rest of your stamina to hit only level 10 renegades for poly. 

The above Renegade strategy will give you 1 million thorium and 1 million poly per day.

Renegades will also give base XP, meaning the base commander who uses skills to defend will be stronger. 

Renegades also provides the Black Ops resources. 

2. We want to always be upgrading the HQ. Why? Because that allows us to get better troops, faster and larger marches, and so on.  

3. Try to keep everything upgraded except resources. Internal resources will not ever give you enough resources for anything. The only reason to upgrade them is so that you can upgrade something else. 

4. Research at least one thing per day (if possible). We have a lot of research to do personally in the game. This gives us faster troop building, marching, stronger attacks, better defense, and so on. 

5. Running black ops important for a number of reasons. The highest you can do at a time without a bonus is 2.  Not only do you receive resources for running black ops, you also receive Commander XP when it is rare or higher. There are different levels which are seen by color coding. Gray is common, blue is rare, purple is legendary, and gold is mythic (Not that those are the real names, but I chose them for illustration). 

You receive XP and resources, but your commanders have their own personal bonuses as well. For example, one is for extra resources. Another for extra XP. Another for speeding up the black ops time, and so on. You can leverage them to gain more or go faster. 

6. Continuously build troops (**If you are ever attacked, you will not lose troops unless you have too many for the garage to hold**).
Building troops, at any level, will discourage attacks. I will lay out which troops do what and why that is important below.


7. Continuously make sure your vault is at its highest level (**If you are attacked you will not lose resources if they are lower than your vault**).

8. Meet the goals for Battle pass every day. This is a newer feature that will give you things that were never available before. For example, in 50 days you can get a base design that wasn’t available before unless you were lucky in the wheel or you spent money to buy diamonds. 

9. If you see dead bases (or farms) be sure to hit them every 4 hours. This will actually give you more resources in the game than anything else. You can hit 10 farms every 4 hours and come up with 1 million oil/steel and 500k poly per day easily. If the dead bases/farms are at level 17, then the average thorium for those 10 bases is around 200k a day. The number for other resources, except thorium. 

# Which Troops to Build and Why?

Each troop has its own benefits and bonuses, but going a bit more basic than that, here is what I think should be built and why. 

Tanks:
These should be built to help be the front force of any attack (renegade or otherwise). They are the ones that are the cannon fodder with power in the attack. 

Aerial:
These have their own bonuses, but are really just the ones who are killed off quickly. They are necessary to keep tanks and artillery (let alone the commander) safe. Having a good amount out front is a great way to keep your other troops in the fight. 

Assault: 
These are like the Aerial troops. They are upfront little guys whose only purpose is to use their bonuses before they are slaughtered. 
However, they do serve another purpose. They are fast in march speed. If you can amass enough for full marches, they will make your renegade attacks way faster than before. 

For example, you need to have enough for lets say 5 full marches of 400k (in power, not troops) for very fast level 10 renegade attacks with 5 commanders. If you only have 3 commanders, you will want to have the largest march size, and full of these guys to make short work of your renegade attacks. 

Artillery:
These are your strongest defense and your longest living troops. They survive because of all of the other troops in the way being killed off. You want a well-balanced amount of these in a fight because they will live even after the commander has been killed off. 

They make marches super slow. You add even one of these to a march, and you might as well add at least 1 minute to the march. So they aren’t useful for fast renegade attacks. 

But they are great to defend your base with, as well as attacking a player. 

# This ReadMe is not finished and will be added to as time permits. 

There is information to be shared about faction research that is important, about when and where to attack, which land bonuses are important, and so on. 

There is also a few tips on what Kind of Faction you have and what kinds of factions are out there. E.g. farm factions, sub factions, growth factions, and the like. 
A note about Faction Research and Faction Activity. 
Every single faction member should be doing faction research daily. If you want to focus on growth, then you want to worry about economy and help time. If you want to focus on power, you want to focus on rally size and all power research. And if you want to balance it out, it depends on the activity of your faction. 

No normal players ever play less than one time every 2 days. And good players are on at least 2 times per day, very active, and are there for every coordinated battle (for land or revenge or whatever.
